This application was created using .NET Core 8 with the aim of keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

Features
Dynamic Functions: I implemented dynamic functions using IUnitOfWork, which integrates with other interfaces to manage the data access layer.

Database Initializer: The app includes an initializer that inserts the Super Admin upon the first run.

SQL Server Database: The project uses SQL Server, where you'll find the test tables and a test file for verification.

Testing Login: For testing purposes, you can log in using the following credentials:

Email: sa
Password: 1

Best Practices
I am still working on incorporating the best coding practices into this application and am always open to feedback and critiques to help me improve.

Backend Focus
While my focus is primarily on backend development, I am working on improving my Angular skills in order to become a proficient full-stack developer.

Authorization
I used my previous experience in API authorization for this project. Although it is not strictly required here, I found it helpful in ensuring the application is secure.

Unit Testing
This is my first time using Unit Testing, and it has been a valuable learning experience. I plan to use Unit Testing in all future applications to ensure better code quality and reliability.

Gratitude
Thank you for taking the time to review my work. This project has been an excellent opportunity for training and learning new concepts.
